****
📌 Overview
This project presents a quality control (QC)–aware machine learning framework for estimating low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) using routine lipid profile parameters (Total Cholesterol, Triglycerides, HDL-C).

**The framework compares four supervised ML algorithms:**
   Random Forest
   XGBoost
   CatBoost
   Support Vector Regression (SVR)

against established LDL-C calculation formulas:
   Friedewald equation
   Martin–Hopkins method
   Sampson–NIH equation

A post-prediction QC validation layer is integrated to enhance analytical safety and laboratory applicability

🎯 Objectives
      Improve LDL-C estimation accuracy using machine learning
      Compare ML models with conventional calculation-based formulas
      Evaluate triglyceride-stratified performance (especially TG ≥400 mg/dL)
      Integrate laboratory-inspired QC logic into ML predictions
      Bridge computational modeling with real-world laboratory workflows

🏥 Clinical Relevance
LDL-C is a central biomarker in cardiovascular risk assessment. Traditional calculation methods deteriorate in hypertriglyceridemic samples.

This framework:
    Improves performance in elevated TG states
    Reduces extreme analytical deviations
    Aligns ML predictions with laboratory quality control principles
    Supports implementation in ISO 15189–compliant laboratories

**🧠 Methodology Summary**
🔹 Machine Learning Models
     Random Forest (ensemble-based variance reduction)
     XGBoost (regularized gradient boosting)
     CatBoost (ordered boosting)
     SVR (kernel-based regression)

**🔹 Traditional Formulas**
     Friedewald
     Martin–Hopkins
     Sampson–NIH

**🔹 QC Module**
    A post-prediction validation layer:
        Flags extreme predictions
        Constrains outliers within biologically plausible limits
        Mimics Westgard-style QC logic
        Does NOT interfere with model training

 **🔬 Key Findings**
        ML models outperform conventional formulas
        Ensemble methods show highest stability
        Performance advantage increases at TG ≥400 mg/dL
        QC module reduces extreme analytical deviations
        Demographic robustness maintained without including age/gender in training
